Encryption Notes (English)
1. What is Encryption?
Process of converting data into a coded form to prevent unauthorized access.

Requires a key to encrypt (lock) and decrypt (unlock).

Example:

Original: "Transfer $100" â†’ Encrypted: "Gh7#kL9!qW" â†’ Decrypted: "Transfer $100".

2. Types of Encryption
A) Symmetric Encryption
Key: Single key for both encryption & decryption.

Algorithms: AES, DES, Blowfish.

Pros: Fast, efficient for large data.

Cons: Key distribution is risky (if key is stolen, data is compromised).

Use Case: Encrypting files, disk encryption.

B) Asymmetric Encryption
Keys:

Public Key: Shared openly (used to encrypt).

Private Key: Kept secret (used to decrypt).

Algorithms: RSA, ECC.

Pros: Secure (no key-sharing risk).

Cons: Slower than symmetric encryption.

Use Case: SSL/TLS (HTTPS), digital signatures.

3. Encryption vs Hashing
Feature	Encryption	Hashing
Reversible?	Yes (with key)	No (one-way function)
Purpose	Secure data transmission	Password storage
Keys	Required	Not required
Example:

Encryption: Email â†’ Encrypt â†’ Send â†’ Decrypt â†’ Email.

Hashing: "password123" â†’ (SHA-256) â†’ "a1b2c3..." (stored in DB).

4. Real-World Applications
HTTPS/SSL: Encrypts web traffic (symmetric + asymmetric combo).

WhatsApp: End-to-end encryption (asymmetric).

VPNs: Encrypts internet connections.

Banking: Secures transactions (e.g., UPI, credit cards).

5. How It Works (Example)
Scenario: Sending "Meet at 5PM" securely.

Symmetric (AES):
Key: "secret123" (shared between sender/receiver).

Encrypt: "Meet at 5PM" + "secret123" â†’ "XyZ12#kLmN".

Decrypt: "XyZ12#kLmN" + "secret123" â†’ Original message.

Asymmetric (RSA):
Receiverâ€™s Keys:

Public Key: "PUL_123" (shared).

Private Key: "PUL_private" (secret).

Encrypt (Sender): "Meet at 5PM" + "PUL_123" â†’ "AbC!2@3".

Decrypt (Receiver): "AbC!2@3" + "PUL_private" â†’ Original message.

Key Takeaways
âœ” Symmetric: 1 key â†’ Fast but risky key-sharing.
âœ” Asymmetric: 2 keys â†’ Secure but slower.
âœ” Always use:

HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites.

End-to-end encryption for messaging (e.g., WhatsApp).

Hashing (with salt) for passwords.
